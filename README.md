# unity-mobile-cloud-build-dashboard

An attempt to implement a mobile dashboard for unity cloud build using expo (react native!!)!

### Why?
I need to trigger and reivew cloud build status on the go, its much better to have a nicer user interface compared to the web based dashboard.

### Goals
- [x] Load all projects form unity cloud
- [x] Project details page
- [ ] Implement simple build trigger function
- [ ] Able to view build status
- [ ] Able to cancel build
- [ ] ...

### Screenshots
here's some screenshots
